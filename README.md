# Library Management System

  

**Author:** Matin Talkhbi

  

This project is a **Library Management System** written in C# as part of the mid-term assignment at Qom University. It provides a complete solution for managing the library's borrowing system, user accounts, and financial features like wallet balances. All the code is written by **Matin Talkhbi**.

  

## Features:

- **User Account Management**: Create and manage user profiles for library members.

- **Book Borrowing System**: Allows users to borrow, return, and renew books.

- **Wallet System**: Users have a wallet to manage their funds for late fees or other transactions.

- **Search Functionality**: Search for books by title, author, or genre.

- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can add, edit, or remove books, and manage user accounts.

- **Late Fee Calculation**: Automatically calculate and deduct fees for overdue books.

- **Reservation System**: Users can reserve books that are currently checked out.

- **Transaction History**: Users can view their borrowing history and payment details.

  

## Technologies Used:

- **C#**: Core programming language for building the application.

- **SQL**: Used for managing the database of books, users, and transactions.

- **Windows Forms**: For building the user interface of the desktop application.

  

## How to Use:

1. **Install** the application by running the setup file.

2. **Create a user account** or log in as an admin to access full functionality.

3. **Manage Books**: As an admin, you can add, edit, or remove books from the library's inventory.

4. **Borrow and Return Books**: As a user, search for available books, borrow them, and return them before the due date to avoid fees.

5. **Wallet Transactions**: Users can add funds to their wallet and use them to pay for late fees or other services.

  

## Installation:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git

## Future Improvements:

- **Online Access**: Add a web-based interface for remote access to the library system.

- **Notification System**: Implement email or SMS notifications for overdue books or upcoming deadlines.

- **Enhanced Security**: Add two-factor authentication (2FA) for user accounts.
